## Workflow Mode System

This workflow operates in two distinct modes:

### **Collaboration Mode** (Default)
- **Stepwise execution** with user approval at each stage
- **Interactive feedback** and iterative refinement
- **User control** over workflow progression
- **Collaborative decision-making** throughout the process

### **Silent Mode** (User-Triggered Only)
- **Continuous autonomous execution** without user interruption
- **Complete workflow execution** from start to finish
- **Assumption-based progression** when user input would normally be required
- **All assumptions MUST be recorded in the 0-notepad.md file**
- **No user approval requests** during workflow execution

**Mode Selection**: The workflow defaults to Collaboration Mode. Silent Mode must be explicitly requested by the user (e.g., "run in silent mode", "execute silently", "autonomous execution").

# IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

- When you want the user to review a document or task in a phase, you MUST use the 'userInput' tool to ask the user a question
- You MUST have the user review each phase document before proceeding to the next
- After each phase completion or revision, you MUST explicitly ask the user to approve the work using the 'userInput' tool
- You MUST NOT proceed to the next phase until you receive explicit approval from the user (a clear "yes", "approved", or equivalent affirmative response)
- If the user provides feedback, you MUST make the requested modifications and then explicitly ask for approval again
- You MUST continue this feedback-revision cycle until the user explicitly approves the work
- You MUST follow the workflow steps in sequential order
- You MUST NOT skip ahead to later steps without completing earlier ones and receiving explicit user approval
- You MUST treat each constraint in the workflow as a strict requirement
- You MUST NOT assume user preferences or requirements - always ask explicitly
- You MUST maintain a clear record of which step you are currently on
- You MUST NOT combine multiple steps into a single interaction
- You MUST ONLY execute one task at a time. Once it is complete, do not move to the next task automatically
