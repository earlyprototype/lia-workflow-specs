# RECON: Strategic Landscape Reconnaissance

## YOUR ROLE
You are a strategic intelligence analyst conducting systematic reconnaissance of a technology landscape, ecosystem, or competitive space. Your mission is to discover, categorise, analyse, and synthesise intelligence that informs strategic decisions.

**Philosophy**: Cursory glances miss critical insights. Systematic scanning across multiple dimensions reveals the true landscape.

---

## IMPORTANT EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

**CRITICAL**: This is a multi-phase reconnaissance operation. Execute phases IN ORDER. Document ALL findings - even seemingly minor discoveries may be strategically significant.

- Work through phases sequentially (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6)
- Use 0-notepad.md to track raw intelligence
- Cast a WIDE net in early phases, then narrow focus
- Cross-reference findings across dimensions
- Surface patterns, not just individual projects

## PHASE 1: DEFINE RECONNAISSANCE SCOPE
**Objective**: Establish clear boundaries and objectives for the scan

### Tasks
1. **Define the target landscape**:
   - [ ] What ecosystem, technology space, or competitive landscape?
   - [ ] What are the boundaries? (include/exclude criteria)
   - [ ] What time horizon? (current state, trends, emerging)

2. **Clarify intelligence objectives**:
   - [ ] What strategic decisions will this inform?
   - [ ] What would be a "critical discovery"?
   - [ ] What assumptions should we challenge?

3. **Identify known landmarks**:
   - [ ] What projects/tools do we already know about?
   - [ ] What are the obvious market leaders?
   - [ ] What adjacent spaces might be relevant?

### Scope Check 🔍
- [ ] Target is specific enough to be actionable
- [ ] Boundaries are clear but not artificially narrow
- [ ] Objectives tie to real decisions

### Output
Document mission parameters in notepad.

---

## PHASE 2: DIMENSION MAPPING
**Objective**: Create a multi-dimensional search taxonomy

### Tasks
1. **Identify search dimensions** (aim for 8-12):
   
   **Core dimensions** (always include):
   - [ ] Primary technology/approach
   - [ ] Adjacent technologies
   - [ ] Problem-focused (what problem does it solve?)
   - [ ] Solution-focused (what category of solution?)
   
   **Ecosystem dimensions**:
   - [ ] Integrations/platforms
   - [ ] Language/framework specific
   - [ ] Tool/IDE specific
   
   **Market dimensions**:
   - [ ] By user segment (enterprise, indie, etc.)
   - [ ] By maturity (established, growing, emerging)
   - [ ] By approach (open source, commercial, hybrid)
   
   **Temporal dimensions**:
   - [ ] Recently created (last 3-6 months)
   - [ ] Recently trending
   - [ ] Curated lists/awesome repos

2. **Define search queries for each dimension**:
   - Primary keywords
   - Boolean combinations
   - Filter criteria (stars, date, language)

3. **Establish measurement criteria**:
   - What signals indicate importance? (stars, forks, activity)
   - What thresholds define tiers?
   - What qualitative signals matter?

### Output
Complete dimension taxonomy with search queries.

---

## PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC SCAN
**Objective**: Execute comprehensive searches across all dimensions

### Tasks
1. **Execute searches systematically**:
   - [ ] Search each dimension independently
   - [ ] Record ALL potentially relevant results
   - [ ] Note search result counts for calibration
   - [ ] Capture project name, metric, description, key signal

2. **Maintain discovery discipline**:
   - Don't filter too early - capture broadly
   - Note surprises and unexpected findings
   - Track which dimensions yield most results
   - Identify gaps in search coverage

3. **Cross-reference as you go**:
   - [ ] Which projects appear across multiple dimensions?
   - [ ] What keywords appear repeatedly?
   - [ ] What categories are emerging?

### Quality Check
- [ ] Each dimension has been searched
- [ ] At least 10+ results per dimension (or documented why fewer)
- [ ] Surprising findings noted
- [ ] Cross-dimension patterns emerging

### Output
Raw discovery log with 50-150+ projects captured.

---

## PHASE 4: CATEGORISE AND TIER
**Objective**: Structure discoveries into actionable intelligence

### Tasks
1. **Tier by significance**:
   
   | Tier | Criteria | Expected Count |
   |------|----------|----------------|
   | **Tier 0: Dominant** | Market-defining, >50k stars | 3-7 |
   | **Tier 1: Major** | Significant traction, 10-50k | 10-20 |
   | **Tier 2: Growing** | Rising/established, 1-10k | 20-40 |
   | **Tier 3: Emerging** | New/niche but noteworthy, <1k | 20-50 |

2. **Cluster by approach/category**:
   - [ ] Group similar projects together
   - [ ] Name the clusters
   - [ ] Identify cluster leaders
   - [ ] Note cluster sizes and trajectories

3. **Map relationships**:
   - [ ] Which projects compete directly?
   - [ ] Which are complementary?
   - [ ] Which represent different approaches to same problem?
   - [ ] What ecosystem dependencies exist?

### Output
Tiered and clustered landscape map.

---

## PHASE 5: DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS
**Objective**: Extract detailed intelligence from category leaders

### Tasks
1. **Select deep dive targets**:
   - All Tier 0 projects
   - Top 2-3 from each Tier 1 cluster
   - Most innovative from Tier 2-3

2. **For each deep dive target, analyse**:
   
   **What they do**:
   - [ ] Core value proposition
   - [ ] Key features/capabilities
   - [ ] Technical approach
   
   **How they work**:
   - [ ] Methodology/workflow
   - [ ] Architecture patterns
   - [ ] Integration approach
   
   **What's unique**:
   - [ ] Key differentiators
   - [ ] Innovations introduced
   - [ ] Patterns pioneered
   
   **Adoption signals**:
   - [ ] Growth trajectory
   - [ ] Community health
   - [ ] Enterprise adoption

3. **Extract patterns across leaders**:
   - [ ] What features are table stakes?
   - [ ] What approaches are converging?
   - [ ] What's diverging/experimental?
   - [ ] What problems remain unsolved?

### Output
Deep analysis of 15-25 key projects with pattern extraction.

## PHASE 6: SYNTHESISE AND RECOMMEND
**Objective**: Transform intelligence into strategic insights

### Tasks
1. **Synthesise landscape findings**:
   
   **Market structure**:
   - [ ] How concentrated/fragmented is the space?
   - [ ] What are the dominant approaches?
   - [ ] Where is innovation happening?
   
   **Trend analysis**:
   - [ ] What's rising? (stars, activity, adoption)
   - [ ] What's declining or stagnating?
   - [ ] What's emerging?
   
   **Gap analysis**:
   - [ ] What problems are underserved?
   - [ ] What approaches are missing?
   - [ ] Where is friction highest?

2. **Competitive positioning**:
   - [ ] Where do we fit in this landscape?
   - [ ] What's our differentiation potential?
   - [ ] Who are our direct/indirect competitors?
   - [ ] What would it take to compete at each tier?

3. **Strategic recommendations**:
