# New Implementations

This directory contains documentation for new implementations and features being developed.

## Purpose

When a workflow spec references `${WORKSPACE}/docs/development/blueprint-1/phase-1/new-implementations/`, it's looking for:

- Feature documentation
- Implementation notes
- Technical specifications for new functionality

## Usage

Place implementation documentation here when developing new features that workflows need to reference.
